    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <h2>The Visionary Behind the Institution</h2>
    <p>
        The Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST) as we know it today was officially established in 2001. This was not merely the opening of a new school, but a strategic "re-founding" of vocational education in Malta, spearheaded by Dr. Louis Galea during his tenure as Minister of Education. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Before 2001, vocational training was scattered across various independent technical institutes. The vision was to consolidate these entities into one powerhouse of knowledge that could provide students with a clear progression from basic certificates all the way to Master's degrees. This move was described as an "act of faith" in the potential of the Maltese workforce to compete on a global stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under this founding leadership, MCAST was designed to be "industry-led," ensuring that every course offered was a direct response to the needs of the economy. Today, that legacy continues as the college serves thousands of students across six specialized institutes, remaining the country's primary engine for professional and vocational excellence.

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
        MCAST was established in 2001 to revolutionize vocational education in Malta. 
        The institution was created to provide a specialized pathway for students 
        to gain industry-relevant skills that directly support the national economy.
    </p>
    <p>
        By consolidating several technical institutes into one unified college, 
        the creators ensured that professional training would reach the highest 
        European standards, bridging the gap between education and employment.
